## 🛠️ How to Install (For Beginners!)

Since this is a custom extension, it is not in the Chrome Web Store. Don't worry, installing it takes exactly 1 minute!

### Step 1: Download the Extension File
1. On the right side of this GitHub page, look for the **Releases** section and click on the latest release.
2. Under the "Assets" heading, find and click on the file ending in **`.crx`** (e.g., `marksapp.crx`) to download it. 
3. The file will download to your computer (usually in your `Downloads` folder). 
*(Note: If Chrome gives you a warning that "Extensions cannot be added from this website", just click "Keep" or ignore it—we are going to install it manually in the next steps!)*

### Step 2: Open Chrome Extensions
1. Open Google Chrome.
2. Click the **Puzzle Piece icon** 🧩 in the top right corner of your browser (next to your profile picture).
3. Click **"Manage Extensions"** at the bottom of the menu. 
   *(Alternatively, type `chrome://extensions/` into your URL bar and hit Enter).*

### Step 3: Turn on Developer Mode
1. Look at the **top right corner** of the Extensions page.
2. You will see a toggle switch that says **"Developer mode"**. Turn it **ON**. 
*(Chrome requires this to be on when installing extensions from outside the official Web Store).*

### Step 4: Drag and Drop to Install
1. Open the folder on your computer where your `.crx` file downloaded.
2. Simply **drag and drop** the `.crx` file directly onto the open Chrome Extensions page.
3. A small warning box will pop up asking if you want to "Add NTA Exam Simulator?". Click **"Add extension"**.

* Press **`Enter`** ➔ Submits the answer / Checks the solution.
* Press **`Right Arrow (→)`** ➔ Save & Next (Goes to the next question).
* Press **`Left Arrow (←)`** ➔ Goes to the previous question.

## 🧰 Troubleshooting

* **The page looks weird or broken!**
  * Sometimes the page needs a fresh start. Click the extension icon and hit the big red **"WIPE ALL DATA & RELOAD"** button.
