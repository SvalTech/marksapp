## 🛠️ How to Install (For Beginners!)

Since this is a custom extension, it is not in the Chrome Web Store. Don't worry, installing it takes exactly 1 minute!

### Step 1: Download the Code from GitHub
1. Scroll to the top of this GitHub page.
2. Look for the green button that says **"<> Code"** and click it.
3. At the bottom of the little menu that pops up, click **"Download ZIP"**.
4. The file will download to your computer (usually in your `Downloads` folder).

### Step 2: Extract (Unzip) the Downloaded File
*Chrome cannot read a zipped file directly, so we need to unzip it first!*
1. **Windows:** Find the downloaded `.zip` file, right-click it, and select **"Extract All..."**. Click "Extract". 
2. **Mac:** Find the downloaded `.zip` file and just double-click it. It will automatically extract into a normal folder.
3. You should now have a normal, unzipped folder containing files like `manifest.json`, `content.js`, etc. Remember where this folder is saved!

### Step 3: Open Chrome Extensions
1. Open Google Chrome.
2. Click the **Puzzle Piece icon** 🧩 in the top right corner of your browser (next to your profile picture).
3. Click **"Manage Extensions"** at the bottom of the menu. 
   *(Alternatively, type `chrome://extensions/` into your URL bar and hit Enter).*

### Step 4: Turn on Developer Mode
1. Look at the **top right corner** of the Extensions page.
2. You will see a toggle switch that says **"Developer mode"**. Turn it **ON**.

### Step 5: Load the Extension
1. Once Developer mode is on, three new buttons will appear on the top left of the screen.
2. Click the button that says **"Load unpacked"**.
3. A file browser window will pop up. Find and select the **extracted/unzipped folder** from Step 2. *(Make sure you select the unzipped folder, NOT the original .zip file!)*
4. Click **Select Folder**.

🎉 **Boom! You're done.** The extension is now installed.
